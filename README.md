Love Sandwiches is an educational project designed to help software development students improve their skills across several programming languages and technologies, including Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a structured breakdown of what the project would involve, including possible steps and concepts covered:

# Overview
Objective: Create a web-based application where users can customize and order sandwiches, integrating both front-end and back-end technologies.

# Technologies Used
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-end: Python 
- Database: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or similar

# Project Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Project
-  Create a virtual environment and install necessary packages (e.g., Flask, SQLAlchemy).
### 2. Creating the Project Structure
-  Organize files into directories for main app, templates, static files, models, routes, and forms.
### 3. Building the Front-End
-  Design user interface using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
### 4. Creating the Back-End
-  Implement server-side logic with Python using Flask or Django.
-  Set up routes to handle different web pages and form submissions.
### 5. Connecting the Front-End and Back-End
-  Use HTML forms to send data to the server.
-  Handle form submissions in the back-end and return feedback to the user.
### 6. Adding Database Support
-  Set up a database using SQLAlchemy or similar ORM.
-  Create models to represent database tables.
-  Migrate database schema as needed.
### 7. Testing and Deployment
-  Write tests to ensure application functionality.
-  Deploy the application to a hosting platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
  
This concise overview outlines the main steps to develop the "Love Sandwiches" web application, integrating front-end and back-end development along with database management and deployment.
